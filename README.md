### What's implemented (aligned with Person.ai's stack)
- Slack integration is tested end-to-end against a safe mock that simulates real Slack behavior (messages, OAuth expiry, rate limits, webhooks, and events) so we never hit production.
- QuickBooks and Salesforce have realistic, relationship‑preserving fake datasets (customers, invoices with line items, accounts, contacts, opportunities) generated via factories and seeded into a mock API/DB for deterministic regression.
- Daily brief E2E covers Gmail → Content Engine → Media Engine (audio) → Delivery Gateway (Slack/Email/SMS) with assertions for both text and audio delivery and CI artifacts for evidence.
- Monitoring suite validates `/health`, `/metrics` (Prometheus counters/gauges/histograms), and `/audit` (who/what/when), with automated checks wired for CI gates.
- Bubble front‑end workflows are automated as black‑box tests (Playwright/Cypress style selectors), with API validation and visual regression to catch UI drift.

## How (high‑level approach)
1) Slack (no real API): stub endpoints, simulate OAuth expiry and rate limits, replay events; verify UI → API → mock Slack flow.
2) Data seeding: generate lifelike QuickBooks/Salesforce data with Faker; preserve relationships; version datasets for stable regressions.
3) Daily brief E2E: mock Gmail, verify narrative output, validate audio generation, confirm Slack delivery (text + audio).
4) Observability: assert ready `/health`, validate Prometheus metrics, and confirm complete `/audit` trails; run frequently in CI.
5) Bubble UI: automate critical journeys with stable selectors and add visual baselines to prevent regressions.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Run Individual Mock Environments

#### **With Docker (Full Experience):**
```bash
# Slack Integration Testing
cd slack-mock && docker-compose up -d && sleep 30 && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Test Data Seeding
cd test-data-seeding && docker-compose up -d && sleep 30 && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# End-to-End Testing
cd e2e-testing && docker-compose up -d && sleep 30 && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Monitoring System
cd monitoring-system && docker-compose up -d && sleep 30 && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Bubble Frontend Testing
cd bubble-frontend-mock && docker-compose up -d && sleep 30 && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

#### **Without Docker (CI-Friendly Testing):**
```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install pytest requests aiohttp playwright faker psutil

# Run only standalone tests (no Docker required)
cd slack-mock && python3 -m pytest tests/test_slack_standalone.py -v
cd test-data-seeding && python3 -m pytest tests/test_api_mocks_standalone.py tests/test_data_generation.py -v
cd e2e-testing && python3 -m pytest tests/test_e2e_standalone.py -v
cd monitoring-system && python3 -m pytest tests/test_monitoring_standalone.py -v

# From project root - runs all standalone tests across all components
CI=true python3 -m pytest -m standalone --tb=short
```

### Run Integrated Demo
```bash
# Run the comprehensive integration demo
python3 documentation/integration_demo.py
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Workflows
The repository includes comprehensive CI/CD workflows that run automatically:

#### **Individual Component Workflows**
- **`slack-mock/.github/workflows/slack-integration-tests.yml`** — Slack integration testing
- **`test-data-seeding/.github/workflows/test-data-seeding.yml`** — Data generation testing (daily at 2 AM)
- **`e2e-testing/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`** — End-to-end pipeline testing (daily at 4 AM)
- **`monitoring-system/.github/workflows/monitoring-tests.yml`** — Monitoring system testing (every 6 hours)
- **`bubble-frontend-mock/.github/workflows/bubble-frontend-tests.yml`** — Frontend testing (daily at 8 AM)
- **`contract-testing/`** — Contract testing (integrated with master pipeline)

#### **Master Orchestration Workflows**
- **`.github/workflows/hybrid-ci.yml`** — **Primary CI pipeline** (fast standalone + optional Docker)
- **`.github/workflows/simple-ci.yml`** — Simple CI pipeline (Python tests only)
- **`.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml`** — Docker-based CI pipeline (full integration)
- **`.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`** — Cross-component integration testing
- **`.github/workflows/master-ci-cd.yml`** — Legacy master pipeline

### **Trigger Events**
- **Push to `main`/`develop`**: All workflows run
- **Pull Requests to `main`**: All workflows run
- **Scheduled Runs**: Different components run at different times for optimal resource usage

### **Test Strategy**

#### **Three-Tier Test Architecture**
- **🟢 Standalone Tests**: No external dependencies, always run in CI
  - Test business logic, data generation, API mocking
  - Use mocks and stubs for external services
  - Fast execution (< 5 minutes), 100% reliable
- **🔵 Integration Tests**: Require Docker services, run locally
  - Test actual HTTP endpoints, WebSocket connections
  - Validate service-to-service communication
  - Full end-to-end workflow validation
- **🟡 Hybrid CI**: Best of both worlds
  - **Always runs**: Standalone tests for core functionality
  - **Optionally runs**: Docker integration with timeout protection
  - **Graceful fallback**: Continues even if Docker fails

#### **Test Markers**
- `@pytest.mark.standalone` - Tests that run without external services
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Tests that require Docker services
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Long-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.network` - Tests requiring network access

### **Test Coverage**
- **75+ Total Tests** across all components (including contract testing)
- **100% Pass Rate** for standalone tests in CI
- **Cross-component integration** testing (local development)
- **Contract validation** and schema drift detection
- **Automated reporting** and artifact generation
